# Deep Learning Methods on EEG Recordings to Predict Epileptic Seizures


Objective:
This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to predict epileptic seizures using EEG recordings. Epileptic seizures can have severe impacts on individuals' lives, making timely and accurate prediction crucial for effective intervention. The proposed approach will develop a predictive model that can identify seizure onset, offering potential improvements in seizure management and patient quality of life.

Background:
Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures, which can be detected through electroencephalography (EEG) data. EEG recordings capture brain wave patterns, providing rich information that can be analyzed for signs of impending seizures. While traditional methods for seizure prediction rely on manual feature extraction and classical machine learning algorithms, deep learning offers the ability to automatically extract complex patterns from raw EEG data. CNNs, in particular, are well-suited for time-series data analysis and image-like representations, making them ideal for this task. In this project, we advocate for the use of the American Society for Epilepsy Dataset, which provides high-quality EEG recordings with detailed labeling of seizure and non-seizure events, ensuring a reliable foundation for model training and evaluation.
